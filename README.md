# Research Paper Recommendation
#### A simple NLP and ML based website which recommends the best research papers similar to your research paper.

## DISCLAIMER ‚ö†Ô∏è
This is a POC(Proof of concept) kind-of project. However, this project presents the idea that how we can use NLP/ML into information retrieval if developed at large scale and with authentic and verified data.

## MOTIVATION üí™
- Enhanced Search Capabilities: Traditional search systems often rely on keyword matching, which can be limited in understanding the context or nuances of queries. NLP and ML can improve the relevance of search results by understanding and processing natural language more effectively, leading to better user satisfaction and more accurate information retrieval.

- Personalization: ML algorithms can analyze user behavior and preferences to personalize search results. By tailoring the information retrieval process to individual users, the system can provide more relevant content, improving engagement and user experience.

- Scalability: NLP and ML techniques can handle large volumes of data and queries more efficiently than traditional methods. This scalability is crucial for systems that need to manage vast amounts of information, such as search engines, digital libraries, or customer support systems.

- Innovative Applications: Combining NLP and ML opens up opportunities for innovative applications, such as question-answering systems, chatbots, and automated summarization tools. These applications can enhance user interactions and provide new ways to access and utilize information.

- Competitive Advantage: Implementing cutting-edge NLP and ML techniques can give organizations a competitive edge by offering superior information retrieval capabilities compared to traditional systems. This can lead to better user retention, increased user satisfaction, and overall improved business performance.

## DEPLOYMENT üöÄ

#### Deployment is done using [deploy](https://github.com/Nihal-Mevekari/End_to_End_Research_Paper_Recommendation_using_Information_Retrieval) branch
#### This website is deployed at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)

## How to use üíª
- Research Paper Recommendation system ==> enter the any research paper based on ML/DL from our [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spsayakpaul/arxiv-paper-abstracts/data). The algorithm will recommend which research papers are relevant or similar to your research paper. 
- Note: When you enter the research paper, make sure that paper name will be exactly as from the dataset. Otherwise, you will get "Invalid search". (Currently, the search functionality is limited to the data available within our database. We are committed to enhancing this feature in future updates.)


## How to run locally üõ†Ô∏è
### STEP 1: 
Before the following steps make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/download), [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed on your system

### STEP 2: 
Clone the complete project with `git clone https://github.com/Nihal-Mevekari/End_to_End_Research_Paper_Recommendation_using_Information_Retrieval` or you can just download the code and unzip it
  ```
  ‚ùØ git clone -b deploy https://github.com/Nihal-Mevekari/End_to_End_Research_Paper_Recommendation_using_Information_Retrieval
  ```
### STEP 3: 
Once the project is cloned, open anaconda prompt in the directory where the project was cloned and paste the following block
  ```
  conda create -p venv python==3.11.0 -y
  ```
  ```
  conda activate venv
  ```
### STEP 4: Install the requirements
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
### STEP 5: Finally run the project with
  ```
  python application.py
  ```
### STEP 6: 
Open the localhost url provided after running `application.py` and now you can use the project locally in your web browser.

## Usage ‚öôÔ∏è
You can use this project for further developing it and adding your work in it. If you use this project, kindly mention the original source of the project and mention the link of this repo in your report.

## Further Improvements üìà
This was my first big project so there are lot of things to improve upon

- Frontend can be made more nicer and more user friendly (PS: I suck at frontend development) :cry:	
- More data can be collected :monocle_face:
